# BRocketSoftware
BRocketSoftware (BRS) is an open source script that can estimate rocket drag as well as stability and performance.
It uses the matematical equations in the references (2 pdf files in repositity). 
This is a way for my self to learn more about python (in the time of writing this README I've coded for 5 days now in python). 
Also, this code will be modefied by myself in the near future as well as have regular updates. (06 feb 2021.)
